# pass-gen

## Description
A simple passwd generator made with python3.

This is a very small python program to create random and strong passwd's,
that are hard to determine and crack.

We include lower case letters, UPPER case letter, numbers and $ymbo|s.

## Usage :

### Linux or Mac :
```baah
$ python3 main.py
.............(randomly generated passwd)
$ 
```
### Windows :
```
C:\path\to\project\> python main.py
.............(randomly generated passwd)
C:\path\to\project\> 
```
Make sure to install python3.x before using.

## TODO's
- [ ] Store passwords along with username.
- [ ] Also the website linked to username and passwd.
