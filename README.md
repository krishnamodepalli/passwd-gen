# pass-gen

A simple Passwd generator made with python3 using random2 module.

This is a very small python program to create random and strong passwd's,
that are hard to determine and crack.

We include lower case letters, UPPER case letter, numbers and $ymbo|s.


Still working in this project, to store the generated passwd's with assigned username and web link.
